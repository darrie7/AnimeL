# My Application

## Overview
Anime tracker using Anilist API built with Cordova. Pure Javascript/CSS/HTML, so can just run in any browser. Code is not pretty

## Stand Out Features
- Sort based on when next episode is released, so the upcoming releasing anime episodes are up top
- Scuffed "Theming"
- Highlighting anime that are currently airing but you are not up to date on in your currently watching list
- Easily update progress
